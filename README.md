# Motion-Detection-Using-Background-Subtraction

Background subtraction is a procedure that separates stationary objects from the transferring items at the scene. It plays a significant role in computer vision applications. In this study, several background foreground segmentation algorithms are analyzed by converting their crucial parameters individually to see the sensitivity of the algorithms to some difficulties in background segmentation applications. These difficulties are illumination level, view angles of the camera, noise level, and range of the objects. This study is mainly comprised of two parts. In the first part, some well-known algorithms are explained and implemented by providing implementation details. The data set videos having different scenarios are run for each algorithm to evaluate the performances. The second part includes creating a Motion Detection with the best algorithm for background subtraction. Finally, the overall performance of the algorithm in conjunction with the premiere values of the parameters is given.
